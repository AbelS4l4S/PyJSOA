# PyJSOA
Please be aware that to be able to evaluate the test bench functions, it's necessary to have already downloaded the Python package [Pybenchfunction](https://github.com/AxelThevenot/Python_Benchmark_Test_Optimization_Function_Single_Objective)
in the current working directory.

In this repo, you'll find a development comparison between the PyJSOA algorithm and six differential evolution algorithms.
